TENSOR HEAVEN - Tenh (pronounced "tench", similar to hyperbolic tangent tanh)

NOTES
- all library code is in tenh/
  * ideally there will be few/no cpp files
- only the root directory (the directory containing tenh/) should be included, in the same manner as Eigen.
- all test code is in tensorhell/ -- there are currectly ad-hoc tests/prototype code (e.g. eigen_interop_prototype.cpp
  and contraction_prototype.cpp), but the "real" tests are in the standard/ subdirectory.  the CMakeLists.txt file
  in the tensorhell/ subdirectory will build all of these.  the executable name for the "real" tests is "test".
- the "actual" tensor lib prototype code is in test/contraction_prototype.cpp
- the prototype code which uses "strongly typed" tensor math is in conceptual_prototype.cpp

current goals:
- more frontends for Eigen functionality -- LDLT, QR, linear solve, etc
- strong typing for vectors -- named vector spaces (including "Generic") and prime/dual distinction (including self-dual)
  * default values should be "Generic" vector space ID and self-dual
  * canonical isomorphism for tensor2 -> vector will need to take into account basis
  * canonical isomorphism for vector -> scalar will need to take into account basis (a 1-dimensional vector space always has a
    canonical "unit" basis element which is the real number 1 (?))
  * template <typename Scalar, Uint32 DIM, typename VectorSpaceId, typename BasisId> struct Vector_t (NO default values)
  * VectorSpaceId should have the Dual space type (can specify self-dual here), and a static type_as_string method
  * BasisId should just be a "name" (a type, e.g. struct DiagonalizedBasis)
  * There should be a generic vector space type -- EuclideanSpace (?)
  * There should be a generic basis type -- StandardBasis (?) -- where the inner product is the identity
- column/row/block extraction/addressing
  * something like a(i|c(2)), where i is a TypedIndex_t<Vector,'i'> and c is an Index_t<Vector>
  * will need to somehow distinguish the type of i|c(2) from something like i|j, because a(i|c(2)) is an
    expression template with a particular fixed index plugged in.
- implement inner products and so forth using Tensor_i.
  this regularizes the implementation and relates to metrics/inner products
  * contractions will "request" the pairing, and if the type exists, the contraction works
    this would allow more flexibility in contractions (e.g. contracting a vector space V with itself via an inner product).
- isometric embedding for various types (e.g. Tensor2Symmetric_t, Tensor2Antisymmetric_t, so that SVD and other
  stuff can be used on them meaningfully, as the SVD and so forth depends on the metric of the relevant space,
  and the way Tensor2Symmetric_t is implemented does not use an isometric representation).
  * the isometric embedding should be the square root of the inner product.

future goals:
- a rigorous test suite, using Lvd test code -- it can handle everything up through seg faults -- and negative compile
  tests implemented at the build level, so that particular intentional compile errors can be verified to work.
- standard in-line linear algebra notation
  * for example, if A is a matrix and v is a vector, "A*v" should be equivalent to "A(i|j)*v(j)", but obviously
    without the need to use an indexed expression.
- optimize evaluation algorithm (ordering operations to do the minimal amount of computation)
- vectorizing as many operations as possible (in cooperation with loop-unrolling?)
- template specializations for particular tensor contractions for speed (using mathematical special cases)
  * for example, an antisymmetric 3x3 2-tensor contracted with a 3-vector is just a cross product
  * a diagonal 2-tensor contracted with a vector is just component-wise scaling
- in strongly typed vector template identifier types, require certain tags (e.g. static member constants)
  in the template parameters -- vector space identifier, vector space basis, etc.
- certain linear algebraic expressions simplify greatly when expressed in a particular basis,
  so having a formal mechanism to work with explicit bases may clarify and simplify some calculations

random TODOs:
- implement [anti]symmetric contiguous_index_to_rowcol_index as a lookup table for speed.
- allow use of same indices across different terms (distinguishing multiplication and addition)
- see if it's possible to do strong range check guarantees for indices (Index_t) -- this would probably
  require a "for each" construct which would best be accomplished with lambda expressions
- rename source files to use capitalized names (e.g. NaturalPairing.hpp) (?)
- move "private" utility functions/metafunctions into the "Tenh::NonPublic" namespace so that they're not in the
  "Tenh" namespace, for at least a little bit of non-public interface hiding.
- make a nonpublic directory and put all NonPublic code in there (and actually put appropriate stuff in NonPublic namespace)
- make a wrapper for creating analogous Eigen::Matrix types which handles the retarded issue with
  Eigen::Matrix<Scalar,N,1,RowMajor> not working because it's a column vector (even though the memory would
  be layed out identically).
- is it possible to specify the default value for Derived directly?
- decide on template metaprogramming naming convention.  something along the lines of
  * Blah_t<...> for types that actually implement stuff and have significant runtime code (is there
    something better than _t ?)
  * Blah_c<...> for the conceptual layer
  * Blah_i<...> for the templatized interface layer (this is somewhere between _c and _i)
  * Blah_m<...> for meta-programmingy things like type lists and related metafunctions
  * Blah_f<...> for meta-functions which "return" a type T
- add "operator std::string ()" to TypeStringOf_t (?), so that "TypeStringOf_t<Foo>()" can be used
- rename List_t::body() to List_t::body_list(), since the body list type is BodyList
- maybe change array (and array-like) indexing schemes to use signed integers, where negative
  values index from the end of the array.  this should probably not include vector/tensor indexing.
- Add _ to the end of all template parameters
- Tensor power of vector space, NOT SPACES.
- make abbreviated type_as_string methods which make types easier to read
- Make references to Parameter within template classes reference Parameter_ where possible.
- The non-conceptual IsBlah_f metafunctions should really be called InheritsBlah_f, since these
  are overloaded to reflect the class inheritance structure.  This is to be contrasted with the
  conceptual layer, where IsBlah_f<T>::V is true if and only if T actually is exactly a Blah type.

features necessary for version 0.5:
x euclidean embedding (using short-term zero-dimensional hack (?))
x eval (for 2-tensors)
x basis specification (e.g. in diagonalization/SVD, and the orthonormal matrix could/should be called "basis vectors")
- provide a way to "name" the basis for diagonalization/SVD/etc
x stub-out: noalias (?) for situations like a(i) = a(i) + b(i), but also to avoid the runtime check of aliasing, so the human
  can specify no-alias in a situation like a(i) = b(i) + c(i).
- additional eigen interop:
  * 2-tensor inverse            - done and tested
  * LDLT and LDLT solve
  * non-self-adjoint eigensolve
  * LU

basis considerations for strongly typed vector edition:
- several choices for bases on induced tensor products exist
  * "normalized" where square roots of multiplicities occur in both vector space and dual
    which is a "safe" compromise in the sense that it is uniform between vector space and dual
    but has the lowest component-to-actual-memory-location correspondence
  * "dual of induced basis", where the dual space incorporates the multiplicities
    which has an intermediate level of component-to-actual-memory-location correspondence
    but natural pairings never involve multiplicities
  * "induced of dual basis", where the dual space doesn't incorporate multiplicities
    which (probably) has the highest component-to-actual-memory-location correspondence
    but natural pairings involve the multiplicities
- the choice of basis will depend on the particular problem being addressed
  * some problems are contraction heavy, in which case "dual of induced basis" could be a good choice
  * some problems are split/bundle heavy, in which case the "induced of dual basis" could be a good choice

implemented features/items:
x operator overloads for expression templates
x trace-type expression templates (where a tensor is contracted with itself, a case which is distinct from * style expression templates)
x prohibiting 3+ summed index expressions
x assignment expression templates
x check assignment for aliasing
x symmetric 2-tensors
x antisymmetric 2-tensors
x custom natural pairing (for non-isometric parameterizations)
x scalar multiplication/division in expression templates
x unary negation in expression templates
x printing expression templates
x down-casting tensors (extracting symmetries out of "broken apart" indexed tensor expressions);
  "bundling" multi-indices into a more-specific "total" index type
x up-casting tensors (breaking symmetries indexed tensor expressions);
  "splitting" a tensor "total" index into a less-specific multi-index
x diagonal 2-tensors
x SVD on 2-tensors, using Eigen
x eigen-decomposition of symmetric 2-tensors, using Eigen
x Eigen interop for using Tensor2_t as Eigen::Map (no memory copy necessary)
x functions for converting Tensor2Antisymmetric_t and Tensor2Symmetric_t to Eigen::Matrix types
x eval method for expression templates (to avoid aliasing problem when assigning)
x no_alias method for avoiding the run-time check against aliased expression template assignments
x Euclidean embeddings for vector and tensor types for when an inner-product-compatible representation is needed.
x Basis identifier for each vector space, giving an additional feature to distinguish vector types with,
  for added correctness, which is particularly useful for the Euclidean embedding stuff.
x allow 0-dimensional vector spaces (this was done via -Wno-tautological-compare)
x relaxed the C++-driven type checking in preference to static-assert-driven type checking, made all
  indices used in indexed expressions "weakly typed", except for bundled indices (e.g. the index p in
  t(i|j).bundle(i|j,p) -- it is necessary to know the type of p for this to be a well-defined bundle).  all
  other index types can be inferred from their use in the expression.
x strongly-typed vector spaces, and only natural pairings thereof allowed.
x exterior powers -- i.e. wedges.
x symmetric powers -- e.g. "vee"s.
x diagonal 2-tensor products of based vector spaces

---------------------------

different multi-indexing schemes
- "split"                 : if t is Tensor2<Tensor2Sym<V>,Tensor2Sym<V> >, then t(P,Q).split(P,i,j),split(Q,k,l)
                            is converse to bundle, implementation would be similar.
- "multi-index"           : if s is Tensor2<Tensor5,V>, then s(i,j,k,l,m,T) would be s(multiindex(i,j,k,l,m),T)
                            implementation may be difficult if there are nested multi-indices
- "streaming multi-index" : s/i/j/k/l/m/T or s^i^j^k^l^m^T -- need intermediate "streaming" type
                            left to right, breaking types until there is a match, implementation is probably
                            recursive and relatively easy.  "breaking tensor type boxes apart recursively"
- "barred multi-index"    : s(i|j|k|l|m|T)

handling more general symmetries
- each "linear" symmetry is an inclusion of a linear subspace into a more general type
- any type hierarchy can be encoded this way -- e.g. including Tensor2Simple into Tensor2
- "split" would be used to "use" the inclusions, going to more general types.
  a split is a more specific type of linear inclusion, where each component of the split corresponds
  to exactly one component of the space that is split.
- "bundle" would be used to "reassert" the symmetries, if you know that the expression has that symmetry.
  would this work for simple tensors?  there would be a nontrivial calculation to assign to a simple tensor.

Notes for conceptual layer and refactor
- In order to incorporate the order-of-operations and diagonal 2-tensor contraction optimizations,
  the operator overloads which generate expression templates should do the expression template AST
  optimization (e.g. if the expression is a(i)*d(i|j)*b(j) and d is diagonal, then this should turn
  into an expression template that sums a(k)*d(k|k)*b(k) with the single index k).  In the case where
  a change of order of operations would produce an optimization, the expression template AST tree
  should be modified here -- this affects the return type of each operator overload.
- Should the index-notated expression templates be done at the conceptual level?  The optimization
  and type checking could be done here in isolation from the actual computation -- effectively
  the conceptual level will produce an "optimized AST" expression template.  While the indexed
  expressions should all be tensorial in nature, some of the optimizations depend on the chosen
  basis (e.g. the diagonal based 2-tensor product one), so this should be done at the
  based-vector-space and based-tensor-product level.
- Provide way to specify/override natural pairing on any given space -- use Alt convention by
  default (this gives certain simplifications), but for example the det convention would make
  use of finite-characteristic fields possible.  NOTE: there is somewhat of an overload of the
  term "natural pairing" here -- the "pure" natural pairing is between a vector space and its
  dual (this is a canonical, nondegenerate pairing); there are other "natural" (but not necessarily
  canonical) pairings of e.g. \bigwedge^k V with \bigwedge^k V^* which essentially induces
  an embedding into the corresponding tensor powers, but there is a choice of a convention here.
  Probably these should not be called "natural pairings", since there is a choice involved.
- Indexing scheme for wedges and symmetric products consists of sorting the indices of a multi-index.
  For Young tableaux, this would generalize to imposing sorting constraints on various subsets of
  indices (based on the rows (alternating) and columns (symmetric)).  Negative signs are accumulated
  for swaps in rows, and zero is returned for repetitions in the rows.
- Grey (gray?) coding scheme would be desired for generating non-symmetric multi-indices for
  when iterating through components for e.g. the bundle operation.
- BasedTensorProductOfVectorSpaces should be EmbeddableInTensorProductOf[Based?]VectorSpaces,
  since basis elements may be non-simple tensors, which would require full 2-tensors to perform
  the embedding.  It's possible that certain BasedTensorProductOfVectorSpaces could embed more
  directly into TensorProductOfBasedVectorSpaces, e.g. each basis element is a scalar multiple
  of a source element, or at most the sum of two such elements, and doesn't require the full
  generality of a general linear embedding.
- An advantage of the "embeddable in tensor product" idea is that "smaller" splits can be done --
  e.g. splitting "S^4 V" into "S^2 V \otimes S^2 V" or into "V \otimes S^3 V", and this might be a
  crucial feature, as it really enriches the type system without adding too much library-template-driven
  code (the embeddings would be neatly packaged bits of code that could be user-specified also).
- Possible idea for efficient contraction of tensors having different symmetries -- express their
  contraction as a linear map (a 2-tensor), then contract this with the outer product of the operands.
  This would really depend on the compiler-specific optimizations that are found in assembler code
  investigations.
- TODO: reverse order of template arguments in ImplementationOf_t (put Scalar last)
- TODO: refactor all the AbstractIndex/DimIndex/Factor juggling to use some standard form, like
  (AbstractIndex,Factor) pairs, from which the AbstractIndex, Factor, or DimIndex values can be
  extracted.  This will clean up tons of shitty metaprogram code.
  Or maybe use TypedIndex_t after all (it would inherit DimIndex_t and contain the factor info)
- Conceptual interface checkers: something like
  template <typename T>
  struct Check_TensorProductOfVectorSpaces_c
  {
      typedef typename T::FactorTypeList FactorTypeList;
      static Uint32 const ORDER = T::ORDER;
      // etc

      static bool const V = true; // used for instantiating/using this check in an static assert

      enum
      {
          STATIC_ASSERT_IN_ENUM(Check_VectorSpace_c<T>::V, MUST_BE_VECTOR_SPACE)
          STATIC_ASSERT_IN_ENUM(EachTypeIsVectorSpace_c<FactorTypeList>, MUST_BE_TYPELIST_OF_VECTOR_SPACES)
      };
  };
  Hopefully this would cause an error if any of the members/typedefs were missing (TODO: Write
  some compile-time positive and negative tests to this effect).  The static asserts would certainly
  work.
- Implement positive compile-time tests which verify that various diagrams commute
  (conceptual hierarchy diagram).  This will require implementing positive/negative compile
  tests in cmake or some such other framework.
- rename *PowerOfVectorSpaces* to *PowerOfVectorSpace* and
  *PowerOfBasedVectorSpaces* to *PowerOfBasedVectorSpace*
- make TensorProductOfVectorSpaces_c and TensorPowerOfVectorSpace_c embeddable in the
  corresponding EmbeddableIn* concepts trivially.
- make the conceptual use of dimension use the full identifier DIMENSION, and reserve DIM for implementation
- Make a full pass to remove the unnecessary members/member types from concepts


Features necessary for "version 1.0"
x implementation of diagonal 2-tensors (of based vector spaces)
- implementation of the optimization for contraction with diagonal 2-tensors (necessary so
  that we can implement inner products and other similar bilinear forms efficiently)
- implement analog of Eigen's "map" (providing a vector/tensor/ext-pow/sym-pow/everything
  implementations which uses some separate, specified block of memory, which could e.g.
  coincide with an Eigen::Matrix).  Maybe do this via abstracting some aspects of Array_t
  into Array_i, making Array_t inherit Array_i, then making PreallocatedArray_t also inherit
  Array_i.  Then the "mapped" versions of each tensor implementation would just flip a
  switch to use Array_t or PreallocatedArray_t (hopefully it can be this simple).
- refactoring the Eigen interop code to be strongly typed, ideally using the "map" functionality
- do more assembler code inspection for each of the compilers we use (GCC, Clang, MSVC) to
  make sure that it's generating code that's as efficient as we expect it to be (this is
  really important).  record some analysis of each, noting the compiler versions for each
- refactoring the unit tests to account for the strongly-typed refactor in general
- writing unit tests for the new code (general symmetric and antisymmetric N-tensors)
- possibly providing operator overloads to do non-indexed-expression vector/matrix math like
  Eigen does (so this library could be used by "laymen" without using abstract index notation)
- regularize/clean up the template code naming scheme (suffixes _t, _c, _f, _m, _i, etc)
- generating documentation (Doxygen comments for the code, Doxygen-generated high-level
  documentation, and LaTeX writeups of the abstract math), and probably most critically,
  tutorials, examples, and some intro material to get people into tensor math who only
  know about matrices/vectors.
- translating LVD code in tenh/meta/lvd.hpp (Victor's legacy metaprogramming lib) into
  "native Tensor Heaven" code (important for legal purposes)
- Talking to Tom about officially licensing the LVD unit test code (important for legal purposes)


Notes for [probable] upgrade to C++11 (to happen after "version 1.0" is reached)
- "Template typedefs" are possible through "alias declarations" in C++11:

    C++11 added alias declarations, which are generalization of typedef, allowing templates:

    template <size_t N>
    using Vector = Matrix<N, 1>;

    The type Vector<3> is equivalent to Matrix<3, 1>.
- All the TypeList_t stuff (which is deeply interwoven into Tensor Heaven) could be refactored
  to use variadic templates, though it would probably be good to do a bunch of experiments and
  gain experience using them before settling on a design/best practice.
- Tons of the metaprogramming uses static const variables -- these can be changed to use constexpr,
  though it looks like lack of MSVC support will hold this one back for a long time.
- Static asserts with error strings will be awesome (no more making enums for the error messages).
- Use nullptr
- Change private constructors to use the new " = delete" notation added in C++11.
- Move semantics for move constructors for various memory-containing structures (e.g. vectors)


Notes/Reflections on the development of a really really template-heavy math library
- The overarching conclusion is that C++ template metaprogramming (TMP) is the shittiest
  functional programming language that is widely used -- it's an emergent property of the original
  idea of making generic code (container classes, etc), and so was never designed as a first class
  language, and that really shows.  Doing things in C++ TMP which are quick and easy in a "real"
  functional language like Haskell require lots of extra red tape (e.g. all the extra uses of
  the "typename" and "template" keywords) and feel kludgey.  The error messages it produces are
  clearly tiny glimmers of the light of Hell leaking into our reality.
- Trying to have the compiler enforce the conceptual type system through the C++ type system
  is untenable, as it is too strict and the compile errors it produces are unreadable.
  * A good trick is to write template metafunctions with less constraint and then use explicit static
    asserts to enforce the conceptual type system.  Ted calls this a "honey bucket" for the compiler.
    For example, to enforce that only up/down index pairs can be contracted in a tensor expression,
    write the C++ template code to allow any pairs of indices to be contracted, and then use a
    static assert to enforce the up/down pairing, thereby controlling the situation when there
    is an index mismatch.  The error message produced is then readable and meaningful.
- Trying to encode the full, deep mathematical relationships in the C++ type system proved to be
  too difficult, because C++ ties its types to code.
  * The solution appears to be (though the full solution is yet to be implemented as of 2013.07.21)
    implementing the mathematical relationships in "pure" types (compile-time only, no code) in a
    "conceptual" layer, and put the implementations in its own layer.  This forces the designer
    not to mix up the two domains, and the division enhances clarity.
- Template code takes forever to compile in some cases.  This certainly happened in some of the
  Tensor Hell unit tests, where there the same templatized tests were being run on many types.
  * When possible and when it makes sense (such as in unit tests where there are many test cases),
    break code that uses templates up into many separate source files, so that parallel computation
    can be used to speed things along.
- TODO: once conceptual inheritance stuff is done, write up some notes on this and about the
  conceptual layer in general.  Should probably look into prior art on implementing C++ concepts
  (boost?).


Notes from Tensor Heaven future planning
- Projects which will use Tensor Heaven
  * Generalized elephantoid reconstruction for more-robust fingertips
    ~ Using valley points to get additional info
  * Multivariate polynomials (c.f. Kevin's polynomial class); will use fully symmetric tensors
  * Higher order SVD (implement in C++ with Tenh, then use some C++-to-Matlab layer interface
    library to provide this facility in Matlab for David's use)
  * General cumulants (also uses fully symmetric tensors)
  * Manifold geometry
    ~ sheaf theory (maps from manifolds to tensors)
    ~ Young tableaux (for Riemannian curvature tensor)
    ~ exterior calculus (uses alternating tensors)
  * Linear algebra "frontend" for Tensor Heaven -- no indexed expressions; use "Hom" formalism
    so that effectively nothing above a 2-tensor is ever used.  The type system will be traversed
    by explicit notation.

    E.g. if R \in W \otimes V^*  and  w \in V \otimes V, then

      R*w

    should be a 1-slot in-line contraction having resulting type W \otimes V, and

      TensorPower<2>(R)*w

    has type W \otimes W, and TensorPower<2>(R) \in Hom(V \otimes V, W \otimes W).

    The C++ operator* will compute an unambiguous in-line contraction (think box diagrams
    with lines connecting the contracted boxes).
  * Tensor calculus library with pullback formalism.
- Features necessary for project use
  * Inner products
  * Induced inner products
  * Euclidean embedding
  * Induced euclidean embedding
  * Eigen interop
  * More assembler code investigation
- Documentation
  * High level abstract math documents (e.g. linear algebraic category theory)
  * Journal articles
    ~ Conceptual layer, conceptual inheritance
    ~ Tensor type theory (navigating the type system, e.g. parenthesizing tensor products
      to get various naturally isomorphic types)
  * Doxygen documentation
    ~ High level "how this works" and "here is the structure of the library" docs
    ~ Class-level documentation of classes, methods, functions, members, etc.
  * Tutorials/examples which can be involved/related to unit tests
  * Code-level documentation of algorithms (non-Doxygen comments)
- Licensing
  * I (we) would like to see it released open-source for general use, and then license
    it for commercial use.  This is something to talk to legal about.
  * Open source would imply that outside programmers could/would submit patches.
    Because of the commercial licensing, we would have to have them give up the rights
    to the source code changes.
