NOTES -- this is an informal/temporary TODO file
- all library code is in lib/
  * ideally there will be few/no cpp files, so using the library just amounts to adding the lib/ directory to your include path
- all test code is in test/ -- these are just informal ad-hoc tests and prototype code, nothing that will be kept around


goals for today:
- interop with some basic Eigen stuff (calling SVD, etc on 2-tensors)
  * API for calling external methods on the arrays stored by vectors and 2-tensors (use eigen's "Map" class/function)
  * some sort of abstraction layer for using Eigen methods on our tensor classes.  self-contained and NOT intertwined in the tensor lib
x operator overloads for expression templates
- symmetric and antisymmetric 2 tensors (full contraction here requires a custom natural pairing -- make this a
  parameter of the multiplication expression template -- NOTE: it should also depend on the basis, and in the situation where
  the natural pairing is "perfect", it will be the "standard inner product" on the components)
- down-casting (to more-specific types) (up-casting (to less-specific types) already happens through expression templates)
- strong typing for vectors -- named vector spaces (including "Generic") and prime/dual distinction (including self-dual)
  * default values should be "Generic" vector space ID and self-dual
- assignment expression templates (which check for aliasing)
